    <h1> How the Corona Virus Pandemic has Affected Employment in Ohio
    </h1> 
    <p> The world has battled off a number of pandemics, and each of them took a great number of lives with them. There is no doubt that historic pandemics also shaped the economic environment within the timeframe they took a toll on great numbers. Examples of these pandemics include the Spanish flu, Cholera, the Black Death, H1N1, and now the Corona Virus. The Corona virus, also known as COVID 19, is a contemporary pandemic which began at the end of the year 2019 in China. To break the name down further, the “CO” stands for Corona, the ”VI” stands for virus, and the ”D” stands for Disease. The virus has spread across the entire surface of the earth and infected millions and has also led millions to death making it a global pandemic. The virus has been discovered to be transmitted through contact and also droplets that form from the sneezing, coughing or talking of infected persons. An uninfected person contracts the disease when they breathe in the droplets, or get in contact with an infected surface and touch their eyes, mouth, or nose. It has even become trickier as it takes weeks before some infected people begin to show symptoms whiles even though they may spread the disease within that time frame. The symptoms of the disease includes, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, congested or runny nose, and in extreme cases problem with breathing and eventually death. Globally, 32,994,213 cases have been recorded and 996,695 deaths have been recorded so far. Since the Outbreak the United States has recorded the most cases with over 7 million cases and also the most count of deaths. The state of Ohio hasn’t been spared either as cases have been detected. The state experienced a lock down due to the rising number of cases. The virus and how it spreads meant that densely populated places stood a higher risk of infections. This is because scientists discovered that the virus spread rapidly in closely packed populations. Subsequently, a number of economic activities either shut down or downsized. This meant that a number of people lost their jobs in the pandemic. Therefore unemployment is expected to be on the rise in this pandemic.  Therefore, this project intends to map the state of Ohio on a county scale how the Corona virus has affected the economy of the state.
    </p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>
        <i class="heading">Describing the Purpose of the Map:</i> This project will map the hardest hit counties in Ohio by the corona virus and how it has affected unemployment in the state. The map is intended for the general public, the Center for Disease Control and the Ohio Department of Health. The map is meant to show that places of higher population density would have higher infection rates and therefore it is expected that such counties would have higher change in unemployment rates. Users of the map would be able to explore see county by county death rates, infection rates, population density and unemployment rates for their perusal
    </li> 
    
    <li>
        <i class="heading">The structure of the map:</i> The maps would mainly be a Choropleth. This is because the data being displayed is recorded within distinct enumeration units and also data would be normalized. The theme the map would be showing are the worst hit counties in the state of Ohio and how that has affected unemployment rates in those counties. The scale of the map would be at the county level, especially in the state of Ohio. The map will display, the population densities, the rate of infection in various counties and the observed unemployment rates observed before and during the corona virus pandemic. Supplementary data for the map will be in the form of ancillary texts (mostly showing the various correlations in terms of age) and graphs which would portray the death rates in various counties. In summary, the map will contain three layers which are county by county infection rates, population density and unemployment rates.   
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <i class="heading">Data sources:</i> The coronavirus infection count and the death counts will be gotten from the Ohio Department of Health through the Ohio Disease Reporting System. The scale of the infection and deaths count is on county by county basis. The data is updated on a daily basis by the Ohio Department of Health hence this suggests that the map will have up-to-date data for mapping. The data, is open to the public.  The population data for the population density, would be taken from the United States Census Bureau. The scale of the population data is on county by county basis. In order to get the most accurate and up to date data, the 2019 estimates made by the bureau will be used in calculating the population density of the various counties.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <i class="heading">Methodology:</i> First of all the data that has been obtained will have to be processed in order to make it fit for the mapping scheme that would be chosen for the topic at hand. The data on infection and deaths are in counts. This means that counties with larger populations are more likely to have higher recorded cases and this would cause a misrepresentation. In order to make all the counties report on one scale, the data would be normalized per 1000 of the population. Also, after the data has been normalized, it would be made into a .CVS document. This would allow it’s importation into ArcGIS online and other map platforms such as Google My Map and Github.
    </li>

    <li>
        <i class="heading">Timeframe:</i> In this part of the proposal you must display in a table the duration, starting and ending dates of the different stages of the map like data collection, data processing, interactivity design (conceptual stage, production, and implementation levels), and production, and evaluation.
